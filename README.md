# Usage of wallet component

## Initialize near connection

near api require [initialization](https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/front-end/introduction#connection) to connect to near network.
To do this, you can use `initNear` function from vue-use-near-api package.
Don't forget the call of initNear must be come up before root component will be mounted and initNear will return promise.

```js
import { initNear } from '@neardev/vue-use-near-api';
const app = createApp(App);
const nearConfig = {
  ...getConfig('development'),
  appKeyPrefix: 'app',
  contractName: 'dev-1622023860692-5474128',
};
initNear(app, nearConfig).then(() => {
  app1.mount('#app');
});
```

for near configuration file, you can refer [this configuration example](https://github.com/near/create-near-app/blob/master/templates/vue/src/config.js)

## For multiple near sign in on the same page

currently, near api doesn't want to support multiple login on the same page, but you can try to implement it via this package.

```js
const app1 = createApp(App);
const nearConfig1 = {
  ...getConfig('development'),
  appKeyPrefix: 'app1',
  contractName: 'dev-1622023860692-5474128',
};
initNear(app1, nearConfig1).then(() => {
  app1.mount('#app1');
});

const nearConfig2 = {
  ...getConfig('development'),
  appKeyPrefix: 'app2',
  contractName: 'dev-1622023860692-5474128',
};

const app2 = createApp(App); // or maybe you can use another root component.
initNear(app2, nearConfig2).then(() => {
  app2.mount('#app2');
});
```

## Declarative Component

wallet component offers two styles to integrate near wallet api into your Vue.js app
Higher-order component(HOC) are better suited for most developers not familiar with composition api. Register the NearWallet components and use functions and data which are exported via v-slot.

```vue
<near-wallet #="{ isSignedIn, handleSignIn }">
  <div>
    <my-profile v-if="isSignedIn" />
    <my-button size="large" label="Log in" @click="handleSignIn" v-else />
  </div>
</near-wallet>
```

```js
import { NearWallet } from '@neardev/vue-use-near-api';

export default defineComponent({
  name: 'my-header',
  components: {
    MyButton,
    MyProfile,
    NearWallet,
  },
});
```

## Composition API

If you want more nice grained control, you can use `useNearWallet` function to compose near wallet logic into your component.

```js
import { useNearWallet } from '@neardev/vue-use-near-api';

export default defineComponent({
  components: {
    MyButton,
    MyProfile,
  },

  setup() {
    const { isSignedIn, handleSignIn, lastStatusCode } = useNearWallet();
    return {
      lastStatusCode,
      isSignedIn,
      handleSignIn,
    };
  },
});
```

Then, in your template, you can use functions and data as your demand.

```vue
<div>
  <my-profile v-if="isSignedIn" />
  <my-button size="large" label="Log in" @click="handleSignIn" v-else />
</div>
```

## State

The useNearWallet function exposes the following reactive state:

```js
import { useNearWallet } from '@neardev/vue-use-near-api';

const { 
  status, 
  lastStatusCode, 
  lastStatusMessage, 
  unitSymbol, 
  accountId, 
  amount, 
  formattedAmount, 
  isSignedIn 
} = useNearWallet();
```

| State             | Type                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
